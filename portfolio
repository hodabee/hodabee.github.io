# Hi, I'm Hoda Bandeh-Ahmadi 

I am a researcher & strategist specializing in deciphering complex social interactions and dynamics. I have over **17 years** of experience conducting **human-centered research** in government, universities, healthcare, & tech.

I was trained as an ethnographer at **UC Berkeley** (BA, 2005) and the **University of Michigan** (PhD, 2018). Most recently, I was a founding member of **Michigan Medicineâ€™s Center for Surgical Training and Research (C-STAR)**, where I managed a portfolio of 30+ high-impact, applied, primarily big data research projects.

In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, photography, taekwondo, and playing my ukulele.
